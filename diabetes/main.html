        <h1>OVER-VIEW OF DIABETES</h1>
        <p>Diabetes: is a chronic(long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Yourr body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar(glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. when your blood sugar goes 
            up, it signals yur pancrease to release insulin.Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body's cells for use as energy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>With diabetes, your body doesn't  make enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stay in your blood stream. Over time , tht can cause serious health problems , such as heart disease, vision loss, and Kidney disease.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There isn't a cure yet for diabetes, but losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active can really help.</p>

        <h1>TYPES OF DIABETES</h1>
        <P>There are mainly three types of diabetes:</P>

        <div class="type one">
            <h1>TYPE 1 DIABETES</h1>
            <P>Type 1 Diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependant diabetes, is a chronic condition.In this condition, the pancrease makes little or no insulin. Insulin is a hormone the body uses to allow sugar(glucose)to enter cells to produce energy.</P>
            <br>
            <p>Different factors such as genetics and some viruses, may cause type 1 diabetes.Although type 1 Diabetes ususally appears during childhood or adolences, it  can develop in adults.</p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <h1>Causes</h1>
       <p>The exact causes of Type 1 diabetes is unknown. usually, the body's own immune system- which normally fights harmful bacteria and viruses- destroys the insulin-producing(islet)cells in the pancrease.</p>
        <p>Other possible causes include:</p>
        <li>Genetics</li>
        <li>Exposure to viruses and other  enviromental factors</li>
    </div>
    <div >
        <h1>TYP 2 DIABETES</h1>
        <P>Type 2 diabetes is a condition that happens because of a problem in the way the body regulates and ses sugar as fuel. That sugar also is called glucose. This  long-term conditionresults in too much sugar circulating in the blood.Eventually, high blood sugar levels can lead to disorders of the circulatory, nervous and immune systems.</P>
<br>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is more common in older adults. But the increase in the number of children with obesity has led to more cases of type 2 diabetes in younger people.</p>
